Requirement specification for the project

Webscraping tool: Selenium

Objective of the project:

I'm trying to webscrape information on home inspectors located in my area. The website 
thumbtack (www.thumbtack.com) hosts reviews and other relevant details on the home inspectors.
The datasets are number of reviews,the star rating ,name of the service provider etc. 
After extracting the data into a csv ,I'm planning to slice and dice the information to get insight 
on how to evaluate a home inspector before hiring they services for home inspection.
