Objective of the project:
 
I'm trying to gather information on home inspectors located in my area.
The website Thumstack hosts reviews and other relevant details on the home inspectors.I'm trying to extract information like number of reviews,the star rating ,name of the service provider etc.
Planning to extract the data into a csv and slice and dice the information to get insight on how to evaluate a home inspector before hiring him/her.
